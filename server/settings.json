The SR Suntour Zeron 35 fork with 150mm travel feels comfortable and is very sturdy to go through any obstacle with ease. The Shimano Deore 1×11 shifters are the best value for money, with the 11-51T cassette giving a huge selection of gears. The WTB STp i29 tubeless ready wheels can be used without inner tubes for more comfort and traction on the forest paths. Shift is DRAG’s new multifunctional, “combat” hardtail. The Shift is available in 3 sizes and has a balanced and versatile character: The front angle is 65.5 °, which makes it great on descents, and the seat tube angle is sufficiently upright to provide effective climbing position.",

The Rockshox Delux Select + Rear Shock has an option for locking up during climbs and enough travel to smooth out downhill bumps. Thanks to the modern geometry with a lower center of gravity and short saddle tube with a 150mm travel KS Rage-i dropper post, you can choose the size of the bike by its length and not by the height of the seat tube. This guarantees and doubles the enjoyment of MTB riding.
